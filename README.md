[Angular Challenges](https://github.com/tomalaforge/angular-challenges) #16 Dependency Injection

## Directions

To successfully complete this challenge, you will need to have a good understanding of how Dependency Injection works inside Angular.

The goal is to provide the CurrencyService at the row level, so that each row displays the correct currency. Currently, the CurrencyService is only provided at the table level, which results in an error as the same currency is displayed for each row, despite each product having a different currency.

One way to achieve this is by adding a second argument to the pipe, but this is not allowed.

### Statement
Your task is to display the correct currency for each row.

### Constraints:
You cannot modify the pipe.
You cannot wrap the row inside a component, as this will break the layout.

## Thoughts

- If you wrap each row inside another component, then you can initialize a store for each wrapper component. 
- I modified the pipe just to see what it would take to achieve the result.  
- I passed currencyCode to the pipe.  I was able to display the currencyCode but displaying the symbol code doesn't seem possible without a dictionary / lookup object.  
- I tried to use patchState inside the transform pipe but you get `Error: NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: '1000 US$'. Current value: '1000 â‚¬'.`
- Also, "Writing to signals is not allowed in a `computed` or an `effect` by default. Use `allowSignalWrites` in the `CreateEffectOptions` to enable this inside effects."
- The `currency` object is already exported so I imported it and used the find method to get the symbol in the html.
